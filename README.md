# Interview Coder - Unlocked Edition

## Free, Open-Source Alternative to Paid AI Interview Tools

This project offers a completely free alternative to premium AI interview coding tools like Interview Coder, AlgoExpert, and similar platforms. I've removed all paywalls, subscriptions, and user authentication â€“ replacing them with a local backend that uses your own OpenAI API key.

### Why This Exists

The best coding interview tools are often behind expensive paywalls, making them inaccessible to many students and job seekers. This project provides the same powerful functionality without the cost barrier, letting you:

- Use your own API key (pay only for what you use)
- Run everything locally on your machine with complete privacy
- Make customizations to suit your specific needs
- Learn from and contribute to an open-source tool

### Customization Possibilities

The codebase is designed to be adaptable:

- **AI Models**: Though currently using OpenAI's models, you can modify the code to integrate with other providers like Claude, Deepseek, Llama, or any model with an API
- **Languages**: Add support for additional programming languages
- **Features**: Extend the functionality with new capabilities 
- **UI**: Customize the interface to your preferences

All it takes is modest JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge and understanding of the API you want to integrate.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ 99% Invisibility: Undetectable window that bypasses most screen capture methods
- ðŸ“¸ Smart Screenshot Capture: Capture both question text and code separately for better analysis
- ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Analysis: Automatically extracts and analyzes coding problems using GPT-4o
- ðŸ’¡ Solution Generation: Get detailed explanations and solutions with time/space complexity analysis
- ðŸ”§ Real-time Debugging: Debug your code with AI assistance and structured feedback
- ðŸŽ¨ Advanced Window Management: Freely move, resize, change opacity, and zoom the window
- ðŸ”„ Model Selection: Choose between GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for different processing stages
- ðŸ”’ Privacy-Focused: Your API key and data never leave your computer except for OpenAI API calls

## Global Commands

The application uses unidentifiable global keyboard shortcuts that won't be detected by browsers or other applications:

- Toggle Window Visibility: [Control or Cmd + B]
- Move Window: [Control or Cmd + Arrow keys]

  - On macOS:
    1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording
    2. Ensure that Interview Coder has screen recording permission enabled
    3. Restart Interview Coder after enabling permissions
  - On Windows:
    - No additional permissions needed
  - On Linux:
    - May require `xhost` access depending on your distribution

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interview-coder-unlocked.git
cd interview-coder-unlocked
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or if using bun
bun install
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Enter your OpenAI API key in the settings dialog when prompted.

## Running in Production

1. Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. The built application will be in the `dist` directory.

3. Alternatively, you can use the provided `stealth-run.bat` to quickly build and launch the application.

## Tech Stack

- Electron
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI Components
- OpenAI API

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Launch the invisible window
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the settings
   - Choose your preferred model for extraction, solution generation, and debugging

2. **Capturing Problem**
   - Use global shortcut [Control or Cmd + H] to take screenshots of code problems
   - Screenshots are automatically added to the queue of up to 2
   - If needed, remove the last screenshot with [Control or Cmd + L]

3. **Processing**
   - Press [Control or Cmd + Enter] to analyze the screenshots
   - AI extracts problem requirements from the screenshots using GPT-4 Vision API
   - The model generates an optimal solution based on the extracted information
   - All analysis is done using your personal OpenAI API key

4. **Solution & Debugging**
   - View the generated solutions with detailed explanations
   - Use debugging feature by taking more screenshots of error messages or code
   - Get structured analysis with identified issues, corrections, and optimizations
   - Toggle between solutions and queue views as needed

5. **Window Management**
   - Move window using [Control or Cmd + Arrow keys]
   - Toggle visibility with [Control or Cmd + B]
   - Adjust opacity with [Control or Cmd + [] and [Control or Cmd + ]]
   - Window remains invisible to specified screen sharing applications
   - Reset view using [Control or Cmd + R]

## Using Custom AI Models

This application currently uses OpenAI's GPT models, but you can adapt it to work with other AI providers:

### Integration Points

The main integration point is in `electron/ProcessingHelper.ts`, which handles:

1. **Problem Extraction**: Converting screenshots to text and understanding the problem
2. **Solution Generation**: Creating optimized solutions with explanations
3. **Debugging**: Analyzing code errors and providing improvement suggestions

### Steps to Integrate Different Models

1. Replace the OpenAI client initialization with your preferred AI provider's SDK
2. Modify the API calls in `processScreenshotsHelper`, `generateSolutionsHelper`, and `processExtraScreenshotsHelper` methods
3. Adjust prompt formats based on your chosen model's capabilities
4. Update the UI components in `src/components/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx` to reflect your model options

Common alternative AI providers to consider:
- Anthropic's Claude (good vision capabilities)
- Deepseek (strong coding performance)
- Self-hosted open-source models (Llama, Mixtral)
- Azure OpenAI Service (same API but with Azure integration)

## Configuration

- **OpenAI API Key**: Your personal API key is stored locally and only used for API calls to OpenAI
- **Model Selection**: You can choose between GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for each stage of processing:
  - Problem Extraction: Analyzes screenshots to understand the coding problem
  - Solution Generation: Creates optimized solutions with explanations
  - Debugging: Provides detailed analysis of errors and improvement suggestions
- **Language**: Select your preferred programming language for solutions
- **Window Controls**: Adjust opacity, position, and zoom level using keyboard shortcuts
- **All settings are stored locally** in your user data directory and persist between sessions

## Disclaimer and Ethical Usage

This tool is intended as a learning aid and practice assistant. While it can help you understand problems and solution approaches during interviews, consider these ethical guidelines:

- Be honest about using assistance tools if asked directly in an interview
- Use this tool to learn concepts, not just to get answers
- Recognize that understanding solutions is more valuable than simply presenting them
- In take-home assignments, make sure you thoroughly understand any solutions you submit

Remember that the purpose of technical interviews is to assess your problem-solving skills and understanding. This tool works best when used to enhance your learning, not as a substitute for it.
