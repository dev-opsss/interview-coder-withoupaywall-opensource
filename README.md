- Move Window: [Control or Cmd + Arrow keys]
- Take Screenshot: [Control or Cmd + H]
- Delete Last Screenshot: [Control or Cmd + L]
- Process Screenshots: [Control or Cmd + Enter]
- Reset View: [Control or Cmd + R]
- Quit: [Control or Cmd + Q]
- Decrease Opacity: [Control or Cmd + []
- Increase Opacity: [Control or Cmd + ]]
- Zoom Out: [Control or Cmd + -]

## How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Launch the invisible window
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the settings
   - Choose your preferred model for extraction, solution generation, and debugging

2. **Capturing Problem**
   - Use global shortcut [Control or Cmd + H] to take screenshots of code problems
   - Screenshots are automatically added to the queue of up to 2
   - If needed, remove the last screenshot with [Control or Cmd + L]

3. **Processing**
   - Press [Control or Cmd + Enter] to analyze the screenshots
   - AI extracts problem requirements from the screenshots using GPT-4 Vision API
   - The model generates an optimal solution based on the extracted information
   - All analysis is done using your personal OpenAI API key

4. **Solution & Debugging**
   - View the generated solutions with detailed explanations
   - Use debugging feature by taking more screenshots of error messages or code
   - Get structured analysis with identified issues, corrections, and optimizations
   - Toggle between solutions and queue views as needed

5. **Window Management**
   - Move window using [Control or Cmd + Arrow keys]
   - Toggle visibility with [Control or Cmd + B]
   - Adjust opacity with [Control or Cmd + [] and [Control or Cmd + ]]
   - Window remains invisible to specified screen sharing applications
   - Reset view using [Control or Cmd + R]

## Configuration

- **OpenAI API Key**: Your personal API key is stored locally and only used for API calls to OpenAI
- **Model Selection**: You can choose between GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini for each stage of processing:
  - Problem Extraction: Analyzes screenshots to understand the coding problem
  - Solution Generation: Creates optimized solutions with explanations
  - Debugging: Provides detailed analysis of errors and improvement suggestions
- **Language**: Select your preferred programming language for solutions
- **Window Controls**: Adjust opacity, position, and zoom level using keyboard shortcuts
- **All settings are stored locally** in your user data directory and persist between sessions
