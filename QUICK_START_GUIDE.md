## 📁 **Files Created**

1. **`LOCKEDIN_AI_FEATURES_TODO.md`** - Master TODO list with 47 features across 3 phases
2. **`AI_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed guide on using AI to complete tasks
3. **`start-ai-development.sh`** - Interactive script to help you start working
4. **`check-progress.sh`** - Quick progress checker

## 🎯 **How to Start Working RIGHT NOW**

### **Option 1: Interactive Script (Recommended)**
```bash
./start-ai-development.sh
```
This will:
- Show your current progress
- Suggest next tasks
- Generate AI prompts for you
- Set up your development environment
- Create feature branches

### **Option 2: Manual Process**

1. **Check your progress:**
   ```bash
   ./check-progress.sh
   ```

2. **Pick your first task (Recommended: Resume Analyzer):**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/resume-analyzer
   ```

3. **Use this AI prompt to start:**
   ```
   I need to create a ResumeAnalyzer service for the Interview Coder app.

   Context:
   - TypeScript/React/Electron app
   - Existing patterns in src/services/googleSpeechService.ts
   - Need to integrate with OpenAI/Gemini APIs via window.electronAPI.handleAiQuery()

   Requirements:
   - ATS compatibility scoring (1-100 scale)
   - Keyword matching against job descriptions
   - Formatting issue detection
   - Improvement suggestions generation

   Please provide:
   1. Complete ResumeAnalyzer service class with TypeScript
   2. ATSReport interface definition
   3. Error handling for API failures
   4. Integration with existing window.electronAPI patterns
   ```
